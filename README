Language-Tea

This module converts Tea code into Java code.

There are some limitations. Tea is not a typed language like Java. We try to guess
the variable types based on the data the variable will have, but this is 
not 100% bulletproof.

There are other limitations, like closures, and variable reuse.
In Tea, we can have closures, using function lambda. We can't yet make a plausible 
translation to Java code. Plus, the variable reuse in Tea is literally translated into
Java code. 

Example:

    Tea code:
        define a 44
        (more tea code)
        set! a "hello guys"

    Tea code translated into Java
        Integer a = new Integer(44);
        (more tea code translated)
        a = "hello guys" -----> COMPILE ERROR

Anyway, we hope nobody tries to reuse variables like this :\
